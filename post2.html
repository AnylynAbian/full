                	<p>Admit it. You like the attention. You liked the feeling of knowing she must have enjoyed your company. You  miss her because she was once a part of your daily routine and it hurts like hell beacuase she is not anymore.</p>
                	<p>Admit it. You were never her first choice.Neither was she to you. But chose to spend time together because other people didn't matter. She was important to you, and you need her more than she needed you.</p>
                	<p>Admit it. You were lost and confused. Bacause when she would hold your hand as you both crossed the street, and would lie on your lap, you would've wished those moments lasted longer. She was at least, at a certain period something that made you feel comfortable.</p>
                	<p>Admit it. You lied to your self when  you said all you ever wanted to be was friends. You lied because you knew didn't want it to end. But look at what it's come to. You don't talk anymore and it's not as "okay" as you'd expected</p>
                	<p>Admit it. At some point  you wish things were different and that the circumstances didn't get in the way of you both being carefree without anyone or anyting to worry about</p>
                	<p>She was simply someone who came into your life and you would've thought she'd never leave. But she did. Because that's just how things are sometimes. They either owrk out or they don't</p>
                	<p>You know that in the short moment that it did work out, it was something beautiful. All she is now is worth remenbering.</p>
